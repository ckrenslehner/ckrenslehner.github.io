Welcome to my webpage! My name is Christian Krenslehner. I am a passionate firmware developer and Rustacean in the making. 🦀👷‍♂️

I believe that writing about things helps with understanding them better. That's why I decided to start writing about different topics. Thank you for visiting, I hope you find something interesting here. 😊
